- Used Clean Architecture + MVVM for separating code base, de-coupling module, and reducing the effort to change and maintain. Easy to implement DI for Unit Test the functions.
- Used Hilt for DI which is designed for Android applications. It builds dependency graphs at compile time so I will know what's wrong while compiling the app.
- UI design and implementation with Jetpack compose and Material Theme because I want to apply a recent technology for the app. Also, the Jetpack Compose is more maintainable, changeable, and reusable.
- Used Retrofit for performing networking
- Used Mockito for creating mock instance functions for testing
- Used Faker for creating mock objects for testing
- Used Junit for testing
- Used Coroutines for performing asynchronous
- Used Exoplayer for playing highlight video
- Used AlarmManager and BroadcastReceiver for schedule match starting notifications
- Change to use vertical lists for devices have screen width > 600 DP
- ...

- If I have more time, I will implement a cache offline app by Room database. Then refactor the UI/UX. Create a leaderboard feature by counting won matches. After 3 days of creating this sample app, this is a good result for me. I got some new aspects of app development and also reviewed my knowledge.

Functional Requirements:
- Ability to show all participating teams. -> Landing screen shows a horizontal team list. Click **Team List** label to navigate to the fullscreen all participating teams
- Ability to show all previous and upcoming matches. -> Landing screen shows a vertical match list. Click **Match List** to navigate to the fullscreen all matches
- Ability for a user to select a team and filter matches per team. -> Landing screen -> Click **Team Item** in the horizontal **Team List** -> navigate to **Match Of Team Screen**
- Watch previous match highlights. -> Click on **Previous Match Item**
- Users can set a reminder for an upcoming match. -> Click on **Upcoming Match Item**
- Notify the user when the match is about to start. -> Click on **Upcoming Match Item**


Coding Requirements
- Application should be written using Kotlin Programming Language -> Meet the requirement
- UI Design must follow Androidâ€™s Material Design Guidelines -> Using compose UI with Material Theme. I'm not good at self-design UI/UX app
- Only use appropriate libraries needed based on the functional requirements -> Meet the requirement
- Integrate unit tests on the project -> Meet the requirement
- Support for Tablet design (Bonus) -> Change to use vertical lists for devices have screen width > 600 DP
